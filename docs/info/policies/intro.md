# Introduction to Foundation Policies

The Atlas Foundation runs on various policies that help ensure order is kept within our facilites. These policies must be followed at all times unless said otherwise by Foundation Upper Command. In the event that these policies are broken, the Ethics Committee will be notified and issue punishments accordingly based off of severity.

The Foundation Policies are a work in progress

It is suggested to remember these policies as best as you can to ensure minimal rule breaking.
